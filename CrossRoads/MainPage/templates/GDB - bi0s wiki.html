<h1>GDB</h1>
<details class="tip"><summary>Challenge Binary</summary><p><strong><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/gdb/resource/crackme">crackme</a></strong> </p>
</details>
<p>After downloading the above file go to the directory where the file is present and type <code>chmod +x crackme</code> in the terminal to make the file executable. </p>
<p>First, load the file into gdb by typing gdb filename <code>in your terminal</code>.
 For this, you have to be in the directory where the file is located. 
Here my filename is crackme. Once the file is loaded, to see all the 
functions defined in the file type <code>info functions</code> </p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb1.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb1.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>We have the <strong>main</strong> function defined. Let's see the disassembly of the main function by typing disassemble main. We get something like this </p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb2.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb2.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>Now the disassembly of the main function is in AT&amp;T format, we'll change that into Intel format by typing <code>set disassembly-flavor intel</code> (I prefer Intel format :D ). </p>
<p>Now let's see the disassembly of the main function by typing <code>disassemble main</code>. It will be like this. </p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb3.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb3.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>On observing the disassembly of the main function, we can say that 
there are 4 compare statements. Let's see what is actually happening at 
those compare staetments by putting break points at those 4 locations. 
To put the break point type <code>b*address</code>.The corresponding addresses are to the left side of the instruction(something like 0xaaaaaaaa).</p>
<p>Now let's run the program by giving some random input (say 'hello') . Type <code>run hello</code> to run the program with 'hello' as the input.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb4.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb4.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>Now the program is halted at the 1<sup>st</sup> breakpoint. Now type disas main. </p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb5.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb5.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>The small arrow indicates the next instruction to be executed. The 
comparison is between al and 0x62. Let's see what is in al. To see what 
is present in al type print $al.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb6.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb6.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>It gives us 104 (0x68 hex ).It is nothing but the <strong>ASCII</strong> value of the 1<sup>st</sup> byte of our input (hello) which is 'h'. It is being compared with 0x62 (98) <strong>ASCII</strong> value of letter 'b'.Let's manually see what happens next.Type <code>ni</code> to proceed to the next instruction. As our input doesn't match with 0x62, <code>jne 0x8048464</code> this jump instruction is executed and the program control jumps to the instruction at 0x8048464.(Type <code>x/x $eip</code> whenever you want to see what instruction is going to be executed next or where the program control is right now. or just type <code>disas main</code>)</p>

<p>These 4 instructions will be executed, "You Lose" is printed on to the screen and program exits normally.</p>
<p>Now we have concluded that our 1<sup>st</sup> letter must be 'b'. Similarly, there are 3 more compare statements.</p>
<p>Let's run the program again by giving 'b' as the 1<sup>st</sup> letter in our input(say 'bell'). Type <code>r bell</code> .</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb7.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb7.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>Now as the 1<sup>st</sup> letter of our input is 'b', <code>jne 0x8048464</code> this instruction is not executed and it successfully goes to the next breakpoint.</p>
<p>Type <code>c</code> continue and then see where our program control is.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb8.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb8.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>Now our instruction pointer is at the 2<sup>nd</sup> breakpoint. Here lets see what is in al. Type print <code>$al</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb9.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb9.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>We get 101 (0x65), that is the <strong>ASCII</strong> value of 'e' which is the 2<sup>nd</sup> letter of our input. It is being compared with 0x6c (108), <strong>ASCII</strong> value of 'l'. So our 2<sup>nd</sup> letter has got to be 'l'.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are 2 more compare statements which take the 3<sup>rd</sup> byte and the 4<sup>th</sup> byte of our input and check them with 0x61(97 <strong>ASCII</strong> value for 'a') and 0x68(104 <strong>ASCII</strong> value for 'h') respectively. </p>
<p>So our input must be "blah". </p>
<p>Now get out of gdb by pressing ctrl+z. Then run the file by giving 
'blah' as the input. Type ./crackme blahto run the file with 'blah' as 
input. </p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/reversing/essentials/imgs/gdb10.png"><img alt="" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/gdb10.png" %}"></a></p>
<p>The challenge is complete. "You win"</p>
<details class="tip"><summary>Tasks</summary><p>Now you have reached a crucial point. This is what you were waiting
for.This is the first real RE challenge that you will be facing.</p>
<p>You are going to be provided with the bomb labs binary. You need to pass
the stages 1 - 6 to defuse the bomb. And there is also a secret level.</p>
<p>Tools that can be used :</p>
<ul>
<li>Gdb</li>
<li>
<p>python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally you can store the inputs of the stages that you have
already found out in a file let's assume it is <code>inp</code>. Now the next time
you are running the binary you can run it as <code>r &lt; inp</code> in gdb and you
can save the hassle of typing the previous inputs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also keep in mind that you can't patch or change the values of any
registers at any point of time. The solution requires you to find out
exactly the password of each stage.</p>
<p>Submit the passwords of each stage as a single file which when run
<code>./bomblabs &lt; inp</code> should clear all the stages.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>Reverse engineering is the process of analysing and understanding a system, a
process etc. It is not solely restricted to software: you can reverse
engineering watches, televisions, cars, bikes, camera - basically any system you
can think of.</p>
<p>In cybersecurity, we usually deal with reverse engineering software: analysing
executables using several tools and techniques to understand what it does, how
it performs those actions and act on it. The primary application area is in
malware analysis where analysts take apart a malware(virus, worm, trojans, bots
etc) to understand how it works and develop defences against them. Software
reverse engineering is also used in other areas such as finding vulnerabilities,
performance and binary analysis and more. It is also an independent field of
research on it’s own. There are several job opportunities for skilled reverse
engineers in the field since it is not a very popular skill and there is a
shortage of skilled reverse engineers in the industry.</p>
<p>(Off late, reverse engineering hardware has also gained a lot of attention but
it requires significantly advanced knowledge and several specialized tools.
Hence we will not focus on hardware reversing here.)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reverse-engineer-software">How to reverse engineer software?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-reverse-engineer-software" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is no standard methodology or technique to reverse engineering software.
Every executable you analyse will likely require a different approach depending
on the executable itself and what your objective for the reverse engineering
process is. However, we will some basic techniques and approaches that will be
useful and required in most scenarios. Additionally, these are a necessary
foundation for developing further skills in reverse engineering.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-engineering-analysis-approaches">Reverse engineering analysis approaches<a class="headerlink" href="#reverse-engineering-analysis-approaches" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to analysing and reverse engineering
executables:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Static analysis</strong>: In this approach, we do not execute the executable.
Instead, we use specialized tools and prior knowledge to infer several
useful information about the executable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic analysis</strong>: In this approach, we execute the executable and
observe its behaviour during execution, using a different set of
specialized tools. By observing its behaviour, we can infer useful
information about the executable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In most cases, you will need a combination of static and dynamic analysis to
gain a better and complete understanding of the executable. Both analyses
approach reveal usually distinct pieces of information and sometimes, one might
be faster than the other. By combining the two, the reverse engineering process
can become much faster. Don’t worry: we will learn all the tools needed and some
examples to demonstrate(and also test your skills in) these tools.</p>
<h2 id="general-things-to-remember-before-starting">General things to remember before starting<a class="headerlink" href="#general-things-to-remember-before-starting" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reverse engineering is a difficult and time consuming task. It requires paying
great attention to detail and connecting various concepts together to make
inferences about program behaviour. Very often, it’s also not necessary to
reverse engineering the entire executable: depending on the objective for
reverse engineering, it might enough to focus on a specific part of the
executable. You will find that you will get frustrated several times through the
process: that is very normal! Take breaks and work through it at your own pace.
Do not rush through to find the answer; focus on learning concepts and
approaches well. We have chosen very simple examples to illustrate the concepts
clearly but without your efforts and focus, it will be hard to learn. This is
not to discourage you, it is something you have to remember when reversing.
Reverse engineering is an extremely fun activity because it’s very engaging and
frustrating at the same time. After you arrive at the solution and satisfy the
objective, there is a strong sense of joy and accomplishment but that requires
in many cases persisting continuously at the task. So it is a difficult task but
can be extremely rewarding(financially and personally).</p>
<p>With that said, let’s get started!</p>

<p>Cyber Forensics is a science which deals with techniques used to track the <strong>footprints</strong>
 left behind a cyber attack.
Cyber forensics is directly linked to any cybercrime which has data loss
 and recovery. Some examples include investigation on possible <strong>forged digital signatures, the authenticity of images, analysis of malicious software</strong> etc.</p>

<p>Let us go into more detail of the definition from a CTF perspective. 
Any Capture The Flag contest usually has three prime categories of 
digital forensics.
They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/forensics/network-forensics/">Network Forensics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/forensics/image-forensics/">Image Forensics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.bi0s.in/forensics/memory-forensics/">Memory Forensics</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scope-of-forensics"><strong>Scope of Forensics</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-forensics" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h1>
<p>When we talk about employment, research or anything, Cyber Forensics 
is one of the prime areas which comes into a security analyst's mind.
Forensics is strongly employed in <strong>Incident Response, Malware Analysis, Data leak protection</strong>. Actually, to sum it up, every cybercrime is always related to cyber forensics.</p>
<p>To really understand this, let us look into a very dangerous virus attack which almost started world war III.
<strong>Stuxnet</strong> was a virus which was found lurking in the 
systems which controlled nuclear centrifuges in Iran.
Stuxnet had a stolen yet officially authorised digital signature which 
acted as a very good camouflage. Stuxnet made the windows systems 
constantly reboot or lead them to <strong>Blue Screen of Death</strong>.
 Stuxnet could easily affect any computer which was linked to the 
network. It was really difficult for security experts to trace it. It 
severely affected the <strong>SCADA systems</strong> which were employed
 in maintaining the rotation speed of the centrifuges.
After heavy investigation, when several forensic analysts looked into 
the SCADA network transfer, they found a malicious program being run 
which altered the system processes. The main aspect which made Stuxnet 
almost invisible was that it became active only when its target was 
present or being run. Until then the virus remained dormant.
So as you can see, Cyber forensics played a huge role in the detection 
of the virus.</p>
<p>Let us look at the trend of cyber attacks based on the analysis from January 2017-2018:</p>
<p>Some handy definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Espionage</strong>: Use of computer networks to get access to confidential information held by important organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacktivism</strong>: Act of hacking which is mainly done for a political purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Warfare</strong>: Cyber attacks are done on state organizations to gain military secrets etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/Cyber_Attack_Stats.png" %}" title="January 2017">
Cyber crimes are at 77% in 2017</p>
<p>Now let us look at January 2018:
<img alt="alt text" src="{% static "bi0s_wiki/2018-analysis.png" %}" title="January 2018"></p>
<p>So as you can see, the percentage has increased to an alarming rate.</p>
<p>So, folks, I hope you understand just how important cyber forensics is in the current world of cybersecurity.</p>

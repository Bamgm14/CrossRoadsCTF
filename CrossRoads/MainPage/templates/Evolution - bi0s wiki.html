<h1>Evolution</h1>
<p>From simple character shifts to involving complex math theorems 
cryptography went through a lot of stages. The roots of cryptography are
 very deep. All started with Julius Caesar who tried to secure the 
messages he sent. So let’s dig back the past to get familiar with 
cryptographic evolution.</p>
<p>Cryptography is classified into (according to the time)</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical Cryptography</li>
<li>Modern Cryptography</li>
</ul>
<p>Caesar Cipher is an example of classical cryptography as it involved 
manipulating the characters of the message. Whereas the present modern 
cryptography is based on computer algorithms, number theory etc. 
Previous article mentions the classification of Modern Cryptography as 
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetric Key Cryptography</li>
<li>Asymmetric Key Cryptography</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="symmetric-key-cryptography">Symmetric Key Cryptography<a class="headerlink" href="#symmetric-key-cryptography" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>We know that symmetric key cryptography is a simplest way of 
encryption dependent upon a single randomly generated key. Larger key 
space is required for it to be secure. Popular examples for symmetric 
key cryptography is DES, AES etc.
AES is found to be advantageous over DES, as the key size of AES is 
double to that of DES.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Think Once:</em></strong> How can sender and receiver exchange the key securely over an insecure network?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trouble with Symmetric Key Crypto is that, sharing a key becomes 
difficult over a insecure channel. This led to the rise of Asymmetric 
Key Cryptography. </p>
<h4 id="asymmetric-key-cryptography">Asymmetric Key Cryptography<a class="headerlink" href="#asymmetric-key-cryptography" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Asymmetric Crypto is highly secure when compared to Symmetric Crypto 
because it uses separate keys for encryption and decryption. Secrecy in 
private key is the reason for its security. It also includes generating 
large numbers and making mathematical operations with them. Popular 
examples are RSA, DLP etc</p>
<p>RSA is the most popular public key cryptosystem and its security is 
based on factorisation of a large integer whereas security of DLP is 
based on calculating the discrete logarithm of a large number. </p>
<p>Though Asymmetric Crypto is found to be advantageous over Symmetric 
Crypto, it has its own set of disadvantages. It is expensive and takes a
 lot of time to compute. Hence, Elliptical Curve Cryptography is gaining
 popularity over RSA as it is faster as well as efficient. Also the 
sizes of keys are smaller making it advantageous over the other crypto 
systems. </p>
<p>Crypto has a lot of scope in future as the communication through 
computer systems increases, the need for security and encryption systems
 increases. From evolution to creating revolution Crypto went through a 
long path and is still exploring different origins. Above all security 
is the main motive.</p>

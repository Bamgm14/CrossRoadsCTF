<p class="admonition-title">Cookies</p>
<p>HTTP cookies also called web cookies, internet cookies, browser 
cookies or simply as cookies. These are some kind of encoded form of 
text which is sent from the website. These are stored in the client 
system or the user's system. These do record every information that is 
done by the client like logging in clicking on some advertisement, 
adding something to the cart, and the pages visited by the client(the 
user). These are also used to remember the previously entered usernames,
 passwords, and some previously used card details </p>
</div>
<p>There are some kind of special cookies like authentication cookies so
 these are used for some authentication purposes, such that the user is 
logged in or not ,is that account is logged in in some other devices or 
not.T he security of the authentication is mainly dependent upon the 
cookie issued by the website and the level of encryption. Such that the 
vulnerabilities could make the hacker to read the cookies and gets the 
access to the data in the user's accounts </p>

<ul>
<li>Session Cookies.<br></li>
<li>Persistent Cookies.<br></li>
<li>Secure Cookies.<br></li>
<li>HTTP-only Cookies.<br></li>
<li>Same-site Cookies.<br></li>

<h2 id="session-cookies">Session cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#session-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>These cookies are also known as in-memory cookies, transient cookies,
 and non-persistent cookies. These exist only in temporary memory and 
while user travels forms one website to another website. These cookies 
will be deleted by the web browser after the user closes the web 
browser. These cookies do not have any type of expiry date or expiration
 time assigned to them, this is how the browser knows how to use session
 cookies.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-cookies">Persistent Cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#persistent-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we know that session cookies don't have any time-related 
expiration time or some expiry date, but persistent cookies do have an 
expiry date so some length of time for expiration. So it means that as 
long as these cookies expire the cookie will be sending the data to the 
server as the client or the user uses visits the website or if the user 
uses the information belonging to the website from another website.</p>
<p>So these cookies or also called as <em>Tracking Cookies</em> so these
 can be used by the advertisers to track the list of the sites visited 
by the user over a period of time. These are also used for the 
legitimate reasons (keep some logged in accounts to avoid the reentry of
 our credentials for every visit) <em>However these cookies would be rested after the expiration time or if it is deleted manually</em>. </p>
<h2 id="secure-cookies">Secure Cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>These Secure cookies or transmitted only when the connections are 
secure so that these might no be captures while the connection was 
insecure (unencrypted connections). And these cookies are made more 
secure by adding some kind of <em>Flag</em> to the cookie.</p>
<h2 id="http-only">Http-only<a class="headerlink" href="#http-only" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Http-only is the type of cookies that cannot be captured by the 
client-side API's. These restrictions do not allow the cookie theft via 
cross-site scripting (XSS) However these cookies are vulnerable to the 
cross-site tracing(XST) and cross-site request forgery(XSRF) attacks. A 
cookie is given this characteristic by adding the HttpOnly flag to the 
cookie.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-cookies">Same-site cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#same-site-cookies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>These cookies are introduced in Google version 51, called <em>Same-site cookies</em>
 these cookies will only be sent in the request of the originating from 
the same origin to the target domain, so to restrict some types of 
attacks like cross-site request forgery. These cookies are given 
characteristic by setting the same-site flag to <em>Strict or Lax</em>.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-cookie">Third-party cookie<a class="headerlink" href="#third-party-cookie" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally a cookie's domain attribute will match the domain that is 
shown in the address bar of the web browser. These are called first 
party cookies. Whereas the third-party cookie belongs to a different 
domain that is shown in the address bar. This type of cookies will 
appear when a webpage contains some external contents from other 
websites such as advertisements or visiting their website. If we are 
using some website named xyz.com we will be having the cookies of xyz 
and an advertisement for some another website called abc.com. So it is 
eventually both these cookies are sent to the advertiser when loading or
 visiting their website. So the advertiser can use the cookies to know 
the browsing history of the user that have his advertisements from this 
advertiser.</p>
<p>Some years back some companies have set the cookies that are readable
 by 100 third-party domains. On an average website are setting 10 
cookies with a maximum limit of 800 cookies </p>
<p>But the modern web browsers containing the privacy settings can block the third-party cookies.</p>
<h2 id="super-cookie">Super cookie<a class="headerlink" href="#super-cookie" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Super cookie is a cookie which is originated with the top level 
domains such as .com or for some public suffix such as .co .uk. But 
ordinary cookies have an origin of a specific domain name, such as 
abc.com.</p>
<p>These cookies are having some high-security concern and are therefore
 often blocked by the web browsers.In case if the web browser accepts 
the cookie and if the attacker is in control of the malicious website he
 could set a super cookie which would redirects the user to another 
website that shares the top level domain or public suffix as the 
malicious websites. For example, if a super cookie with an origin of 
.com could affect the request of the abc.com even if the cookie does not
 originate from abc.com.So that it can be used for the fake logins and 
change in the user information.</p>
<p>The public suffix helps to migrate the risks that super cookie could 
cause. The public suffix list cross-vendor initiative that aims to 
provide an accurate and up-to-date list of domain names and suffixes. </p>
<h2 id="note">Note<a class="headerlink" href="#note" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This super cookie sometimes is also used for tracking purposes that 
do not relate to HTTP cookies. These mechanisms were found at Microsoft 
website in August 2011. Due to media attention, they disabled these 
cookies </p>
